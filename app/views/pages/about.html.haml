  My love for animals began when I was about 9 years old when I started working at a 20- acre horse farm in exchange for riding lessons.

  I was responsible for feeding and barn maintanance for 20 horses 2 times a day.

  Becoming a pet owner I began caring for all types of pets from horses to dogs and cats to 6 ft iguanas.

  I became a pet sitter after realizing how difficult it was to find a reliable, caring sitter when your beloved pets could not travel. I believe the best trip results from not worrying about
  your animals while away and you animals being comfortable and cared for while you are gone.

  I charge reasonable rates with satisfaction guaranteed.  I want you and your animals to be happy and smiling.
